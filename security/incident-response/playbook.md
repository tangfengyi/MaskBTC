# Security Incident Response Playbook

## 1. Introduction

This playbook outlines the procedures for handling security incidents in our blockchain-based application. It covers detection, response, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.

## 2. Incident Classification

### Severity Levels:
- **Critical (P1):** System-wide outage or major security breach
- **High (P2):** Significant service disruption or potential data compromise
- **Medium (P3):** Limited impact on operations
- **Low (P4):** Minor issues or vulnerabilities

## 3. Detection and Reporting

### Monitoring Tools:
- Chainalysis for blockchain transaction monitoring
- Sentry for application error tracking
- Server logs and metrics

### Reporting Channels:
- Emergency hotline: +1-800-555-1234
- Email: security@maskly.com
- Internal Slack channel: #security-incidents

## 4. Initial Response (0-30 minutes)

1. **Verification**
   - Confirm incident authenticity
   - Gather initial information
   - Determine severity level

2. **Notification**
   - Inform security team lead
   - Activate incident response team
   - Notify relevant stakeholders

3. **Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Pause smart contract operations
   - Restrict access to sensitive areas

## 5. Detailed Response (30-120 minutes)

### Technical Actions:
- Analyze blockchain transactions
- Review system logs
- Check network traffic patterns
- Verify smart contract states

### Team Coordination:
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Set up communication channels
- Establish regular update schedule

## 6. Containment and Eradication

### Smart Contract Actions:
- Pause contract operations using emergency functions
- Deploy backup contracts if necessary
- Implement mitigation measures

### Infrastructure Actions:
- Block malicious IP addresses
- Rotate API keys and credentials
- Apply temporary firewall rules

## 7. Recovery (2-24 hours)

1. **System Restoration**
   - Gradual service restart
   - Monitor system behavior
   - Validate data integrity

2. **Smart Contract Recovery**
   - Deploy fixed versions
   - Re-enable paused functions
   - Verify contract balances

3. **User Communication**
   - Prepare public statement
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide mitigation instructions

## 8. Post-Incident Activities

### Documentation:
- Create detailed incident report
- Record timeline of events
- Document lessons learned

### Improvement:
- Update security policies
- Enhance monitoring capabilities
- Conduct team training sessions

### Testing:
- Perform penetration testing
- Run disaster recovery drills
- Validate new security measures
